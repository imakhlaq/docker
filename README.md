# DOCKER

Docker let's you containerise your application.

## Container

You can think container as tiny VM.

- It has its own file system.
- It has its network.
- Its has separate os from your os.
- ( Think of it like dual booting. And running container on separate os i.e. VM )

If you run a program inside a container then yor main os doesn't care about it. The program runs separate from our os.
